		 Bike Tested: KTM, Version:390 Duke [2017-2018]</font><br><br>
		 <font color="black" size="4px">
		 	The KTM Duke range has always been a hacksaw in a world of kitchen knives. The 200 Duke and the 390 Duke redefined our perception of performance and lightness. They stood apart from the herd of commuter bikes, and ushered in a new reality for enthusiasts. However, while a hacksaw would get the job done in a jiffy, it also means one would have to put up with its raw character. It has been four years since the 200 Duke came out, and KTM has been busy, in the meantime, trying to add finesse to the hacksaw. And here is the result - the new KTM 250 Duke.The 250 Duke was initially conceived for select south-east Asian markets to take advantage of their tax regulations - sort of like the sub-four metre rule for cars in India. Now with the new 390 Duke stepping into a higher price bracket, the 250 Duke has been introduced here to fill the void between the flagship bike and the 200 Duke. The 250 Duke gets KTM’s new-age styling with an edgy headlamp and LED DRLs, a more powerful engine and friendlier ergonomics compared to the 200 Duke. On the other hand, it saves costs by carrying over the cycle parts, instrument cluster and a few other bits. On paper, KTM has managed to attain the perfect middle ground - the 250 Duke is more powerful and fancier than the 200 Duke, but not enough to confuse the prospective 390 Duke buyers. But how does that translate in the real world?Minor revisions to the ergonomics have made the KTM 250 Duke a more comfortable bike to sit on, even for six-foot plus giants. However, while the thicker and wider seat might be marginally more comfortable as far as KTM seats go, it still leaves a lot to be desired. It also gets a bigger 13.5-litre metal fuel tank, which means that using magnetic tank bags is no longer an issue. The MRF Revz tyres on the 250 Duke are ‘H’ rated, and the rubber is a softer compound as compared to the 200 Duke.Overheating has always been the Duke range’s Achilles heel, and things aren’t any different with the 250 Duke. While negotiating city traffic, you can constantly hear the loud radiator fan working overtime to prevent the engine from overheating. This can pose a problem if you plan to use the bike for commuting in heavy traffic.

Best bike ever 11 months ago by Srikar</font><br>
I have a dream of buying a sports bike but i thought of getting r15 for a cheaper price than this. But but it's just 150cc and performance is not good. Then i thought of buying kawasaki ninja 300 which is much costlier then my friend suggested about this bike.<br><br>

I bet you all. You all won't get a better performance bike in this 1 year ago by Swaikat Kazi</font><br>
Style looks stunning and great aggressive. Led lights works fabulously. Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox ride by wire makes throttle response very sharp. Fuel economy is not so good in city but good in highways. Sliipper clutch makes gear shifting super.<br><br>
