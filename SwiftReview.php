		 	The all-important question of ‘kitna deti hai highway pe’ has been answered and it looks quite impressive. In real world conditions and with two different drivers and varied road conditions, the Swift with its five-speed automated manual transmission was able to give us an efficiency of 20.4kmpl. What’s more even after knocking off 498kms, we still had a quarter of a tank and a possible range of up to 116km giving us a total of 614km.Now, the car has a 37-litre tank and an ARAI F.E figure of 28.4kmpl which would put the total theoretical range at 1050km, a mighty impressive figure but a bit hard to achieve. We feel that our 614km figure is equally impressive when you consider that this is in real world conditions. However, given that this is a diesel variant, we wouldn’t recommend that you push your luck with regard to how far you can go in terms of distance and you should tank up if your DTE readout drops to under 50km.On both journeys, the car clocked over 1000km. There were no issues with regard to seating as all the occupants were very comfortable. The well contoured seats provided enough support all around while the pliant ride meant, the car took most of rutted rural roads without losing its composure too much.Added to this mix was the fact that my family had recently brought in a four-legged member to the troupe. Ray really enjoyed his first big car journey and this has lead me to believe that he definitely gives a paws-up! To the Swift as a highway companion.

         	A practical car is the one which is most convenient to travel and live with. And there are very few other cars which can beat Swift in this parameter. The Swift always had the right ergonomics. It was designed with a typical Indian usage in mind. And now in its third act, Maruti has also ironed out all the issues of the previous two generations. The Swift feels like it was designed to be a daily commuter in the first place. Its dimensions are perfect for zipping around effortlessly in the traffic. The balanced steering also helps in the city commute. Here we have the ZDi AMT trim with us and the two-paddle set-up instantly takes away all the driving stress in the city’s bumper to bumper traffic. The AMT lag takes some time to get used to, though. It shifts at around 2000-2200 rpm to a moderate throttle and if you input it correctly, the lag can be minimised. However, like all AMTs, if you floor the pedal, the transmission feels slightly sluggish, but that rarely happens in everyday driving.The Swift passes our rigorous five labour test with flying colours. It has proved why it has remained India’s favourite hatchback, especially in a cutthroat market like ours. The Swift is a family car, a multi-tasker that can be your daily driver, your weekend companion and at times it can double up as your fun car as well. The addition of AMT has made it even more convenient for a day-to-day usage. Backed up by Maruti’s reliability and unparalleled service network, the Swift continues to be the formidable champion in its segment.
