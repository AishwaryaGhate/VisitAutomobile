A legend to own 1 month ago by Gavaskar</font><br>
Always wanted this bike cause of its legendary history and classic look. So wondering whether to purchase a pre-owned awesome looking bike or new 2018 version with leds and new graphics. The only issue is that its price competes not ktm 200 series bikes but ktm 390 series.<br><br>

Best bike for everything  5 months ago by Vyas</font><br>
I got it delivered in 6 days which is quite good for a bike like honda cbr. It's amazing to ride. I have been having it for the past 6 yrs. Honda is always the best. The look is crazy. People can't get their eyes off it. I'm gonna get the next version soon cause i don't want to wait more.<br><br>
