The Dacia Duster is a compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced jointly by the French manufacturer Renault and its Romanian subsidiary Dacia since 2010. It is currently at its second generation, that was launched in the autumn of 2017, and it has also been marketed as the Renault Duster in certain markets, such as India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, Mexico, Egypt, South Africa, Ukraine, the UAE and in South America.Its first generation was also rebadged as the Nissan Terrano in Russia and India.It is the third model of the Dacia brand based on the Logan platform, after the Sandero.
A four-door double cab pick-up was launched at the end of 2015 in South America, marketed as the Renault Duster Oroch. <br><br>
<font color="red">First Generation </font> The Duster was initially introduced in the ice racing version prepared for the Andros Trophy, presented for the first time on 17 November 2009.The production version was revealed to the media on 8 December 2009,[8] and was subsequently launched at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2010.
Based on the B0 platform, the Duster measures 4.31 metres (169.7 in) in length, 1.82 metres (71.7 in) in width and has 210 mm (8.3 in) of ground clearance. Its luggage space has a volume of up to 475 litres (16.8 cu ft), while with the rear benchseat folded and tipped forward, its carrying ability can exceed 1,600 litres (57 cu ft). <br><br>

<font color="red">Second Generation </font> A second generation was announced between 14 and 24 September 2017 during Frankfurt Motor Show with actual models reaching the Romanian market six weeks later in November 2017.
The new model has nearly the same length and comes with five seats, unlike pre-launch rumors that there will be a seven-seat model available. It is built on the same B0 platform as the first generation. It now features an electric power-steering, a MultiView camera system that is made-up of four cameras, blind spot warning system, automatic air-conditioning, keyless entry and ignition system, and daytime running lights.The ground clearance has been increased and a hill-start assist system is also offered, as well as hill descent control.
