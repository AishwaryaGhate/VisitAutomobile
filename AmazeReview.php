		 	Why I would buy it: Upmarket looks, fresh cabin styling, more feature-ridden, easy of driving (CVT), solid warranty.<br>Why I would avoid it:Petrol engine does not sound refined, rear headroom cramped for tall occupants, if seating three at the rear is important to you.When it comes to compact sedans, its Honda’s turn to flex its muscle with its all-new Amaze that’s slated to be launched on 16 May.<br> This car has modern looks, fresh interiors with more features, a new lighter platform with better dissipation for rear and side collision, and the addition of a diesel CVT gearbox. Since we’ve already covered the diesels in our previous review, we will now focus on the petrol twins.Let’s take it for granted that you’re reading this review since a petrol fits your bill, be it the manual or the CVT. So refinement is up there in the list of expectations. However, what you need to know is that Honda could have strengthened the noise insulation jobs on the petrol to make it sound more refined and less coarse. And the rear head room can get cramped for tall passengers.Nevertheless, what goes in the favour of the petrol Amaze’s favour is the crisp gearbox shifting action with a light clutch pedal (manual), the ease of driving offered by an automatic transmission (CVT), a new lighter platform with more resistance to collisions, an upmarket look with more relevant features, and a better ride quality. Plus, Honda is betting hard on the standard three years ‘unlimited’ km warranty, fourth and fifth year ‘unlimited’ km extended warranty, a service interval that spans 1 year/10,000km and the annual maintenance package AMC that costs just Rs 3500 for the petrol.

         	Why I would buy it:Better NVH characteristics, all-new looks, fresh interior design, additional features, easy to drive (CVT) <br>Why I would avoid it:If you are looking for comfortable rear seating for three, cramped rear headroom.<br>Honda is ready to induct its all-new Amaze into the Indian compact sedan segment on 16 May. In case you didn’t know already, the second-generation Honda Amaze is based on a new platform. However, the talking point of this iteration definitely has to be the addition of a CVT gearbox on the diesel variant from a mainstream manufacturer. This essentially means that the diesel and petrol mills will now be available with both the manual and automatic transmission.When it comes to appearance, the Amaze is an amalgamation of design cues from Honda’s own CR-V, Civic and City. So, the more angular headlamp design, chrome intense grille and tail lights may ring a few bells. But having said that, there’s no doubt that the overall design is far more sophisticated than the outgoing model. This is essentially due to a more flowing shape, snazzy nose, prominent shoulder crease, smart alloys and a higher bonnet-line. But, it still carries a chopped-off look especially on the front end.What marks the all new Honda Amaze down is the slightly rubbery diesel gearshift, a tad heavier clutch pedal (over the petrol), cramped rear head room for tall occupants. What helps the all-new Honda Amaze claw back into the segment are its desirable looks (pun intended), an updated feature list, a new platform with larger dimensions and a more sorted ride. The highlight is invariably its attractive looks and availability of the new CVT gearbox version on the diesel variant. The 2018 Amaze makes sense to those who are looking for a safe and spacious compact sedan that looks contemporary, is feature laden, easy to drive, and offers one the peace of mind involved in owning a Honda. We also feel that the price of the all new Honda Amaze will be crucial to its success, but we’ll just have to wait it out till mid-May to find out.

Poor Honda Producr
for Honda Amaze on 07-Oct-2018 by Kaushal Mishra</font><br>

It’s a comfortable car but very poor suspension and bad petrol,consumption average. The dealer is responsive but Honda is not willing to listen to its customers. Honda claim of ideal reasons.<br><br>

Honda Amaze an unbiased perspective
for Honda Amaze on 23-Sep-2018 by Krishnanand P Heble</font><br>

The Dream Honda team at Jivan Jyot Pvt Ltd Vapi is great, though they faltered a bit in the beginning but their intentions were noble & things were sorted out. The vehicle handing over was a bit bad no proble with the car<br><br>
