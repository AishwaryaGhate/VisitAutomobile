		 Car Tested: Fortuner, Version: 2.8 4x4 AT [2016-2017]</font><br><br>

		 	The Toyota Fortuner is one of the most popular vehicles in the market today and not without reason. It boasts legendary reliability, is extremely capable and now with the new model, it has managed to ditch the old car’s somewhat rudimentary roots as well. It gets a new engine, a massively reworked chassis and a bucket load of electronic aids. So yes, it seems Toyota has made a good car better. In the real world, the Fortuner is the ultimate politician’s car, hauling VIP’s from one place to another, but out here it’s just raw nature v/s the car. Will it be able to handle the barrage of off-road tests that we have lined up for it? Time to get the Fortuner’s boots dirty and find out.If you are a fan of the manga series ‘Initial D’, you would notice the similarity to our beaker test. Our tester had to sit with a beaker full of water while the car went over a rough section. The car that would spill the least amount of water would win. One would expect the car with the softest suspension to nail the test and the Fortuner with its exceptional ground clearance along with long travel suspension that gets pitch and bounce control was expected to do well.But unfortunately it didn’t. It rocked and rolled spilling the maximum amount of water among them all — 90ml to be exact. The Fortuner was always roly-poly when it came to ride quality and that nature was amplified in the really rough sections.The Fortuner in the real world is a luxury SUV that undertakes a majority of commute duties in the city along with the occasional trip to the farmhouse. Compared to this, subjecting it to our off-road tests was pretty much like Clark Kent handling Superman’s duty without actually changing into red-blue suit. But then that describes the Fortuner to the tee. It’s as comfortable attending red carpet events as it is getting its boots dirty. And talking about boots, we think the Fortuner would have performed even better had it come with mud-terrain tyres. But then, there’s always another time!

         	Toyota Fortuner fans rejoice! The brand new version of the brawny SUV has finally reached our shores and if initial impressions are anything to go by, then it is safe to say that Toyota has managed to improve on the old car in every aspect. The Fortuner has a cult following and for a good reason. Its butch looks, rugged ladder frame, go anywhere capability and bulletproof reliability made it an instant hit. But now, seven years down the line the Fortuner was showing its age and fresh competition in form of the impressive new Ford Endeavour meant, sales figures for the Toyota SUV had started to decline. Now though, its replacement is here. Meet the new for 2016 Toyota Fortuner. And, if looks are anything to go by, it was certainly worth the wait.This new Fortuner comes with a 2.8-litre diesel engine similar to the one in the recently launched Innova Crysta. Although it makes similar power of 174bhp as the Innova, the torque rating of 420Nm for the manual and 450Nm for the automatic are significantly higher than the latter.The extra torque is welcome because the Fortuner is 185kg heavier than its MPV sibling.As a product, the new Fortuner is a huge jump over the older car. It feels more premium, has a potent diesel engine, is spacious, and quality and cabin ambiance has taken a big jump forward too. On the downside the stiff kneed ride is a bit of a letdown and the cabin quality though consistent is not what you expect of a car costing Rs 31.12 lakh (ex-Delhi) in the top 4x4 diesel automatic trim. The fact that it is more than a lakh expensive and isn’t as well equipped as the new Endeavour further marks it down. But, what you do get instead is an SUV that gives you peace of mind like no other, will be as reliable as your pet dog, and has loads of in-your-face appeal. So, even though the new Fortuner might not be the perfect SUV, it is one you can’t go wrong with.

Looks service and buying experience great. Very bumpy ride when Offroading or poor surface. Needs better automatic transmission. Rear seat passenger feels claustrophobic.
