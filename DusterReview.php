		 	Suppose you have to traverse an unknown and treacherous path and you have five off-roaders to choose from. You know you should be thinking with your head and not with your heart. What would you opt for? The best of the lot isn’t it? My heart still made me grab the keys of the Renault Duster! The car was dismissed as the weak link of the lot, so I challenged myself to take account of its limitations and extract the most of its capabilities. So what eventually? Did I get stuck in the woods? Or did I have a great excursion? Let me take you through what all happened.First up was the broken road and lot of gravel to reach our first gathering point. Small stones were brushed off easily. Pretty easy task. Then came the rocky patches, which were again fine. I switched from 2WD to auto. I knew I didn’t have the option of engaging the gearbox into low-range, but had the electronically controlled AWD system that had its electronics doing their job in a better way.Moving ahead to the next challenge. We had to get down a deep rutted steep descent. To add to the difficulty, rains had made the slope slippery. Then the thought of not having descent control and running on road tyres also gave me the jitters. Anyway, I gathered up the courage to drive down. The vehicle slipped at times, but thankfully the stones helped hold ground. The road tyres gripped well to my surprise. Thanks to the Duster’s shortened gear ratios (utmost credits to the first gear), I didn’t feel the need to continuously brake while crawling down the slope successfully.So here it is. I feel the Duster AWD won’t make you feel invincible or unstoppable. You will have to think twice before flinging this vehicle anywhere. But to come to think of it, it is such a comfortable off-roader at an affordable price. Its suspension is so well tuned for mud plugging and well-calibrated to take some beating. True, the SUV doesn’t get the most sophisticated AWD systems around, but is quite robust and can tackle some rough patches and tough situations.

         	There is no denying that the Renault Duster is a pretty versatile car and with the addition of an AMT gearbox, it’s become one of those ‘do-it-all’ vehicles that are rare to come by. Yet while all of us here at CarWale have been charmed by the Duster’s rugged appeal and practical nature since it joined our fleet, it’s been difficult to ignore some of its flaws.The first thing to say is how comfortable the Duster AMT is to sit in. It’s never been particularly exciting car to drive around the twisties, but once on the highway it eats up the distance. The seat fabric, compared to the old model, has improved big time and now it actually feels fit for the price. The front seats, too, are wide and accommodating, with the driver’s side featuring a handy armrest. So with comfort, practicality and fuel efficiency ticked off, what’s not to like? Well the Duster has lived a rather busy life in the hands of our ace lensman and as a result, it’s racked up nearly 10,000km in the last three months. The high mileage seems to have taken a toll on some of the cabin plastics and oddly enough, the driver’s seat railing mechanism that’s become loose at one end. This has led to some unwanted play and seat base wobble over really bad roads.
