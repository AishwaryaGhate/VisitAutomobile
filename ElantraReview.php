		 	Though Hyundai claims the chassis to be all-new on the Elantra, the basic architecture is quite similar to the car it replaces. Proof of this is the wheelbase, which at 2700mm is exactly the same as before. But that’s where the similarities end. The new Elantra gets a more rigid structure thanks to Hyundai using 53 per cent advanced high-strength steel compared to 21 per cent from the previous model. This means overall body stiffness has gone up by 29.5 per cent and bending strength has gone up by 25.3 per cent too.The petrol Elantra automatic is powered by a new 1999cc naturally aspirated petrol motor which is good for 152bhp. The motor is quite smooth and its free revving nature helps you make good progress. Although it is a bit weak at lower revs, the torque converter does a good job of masking this. There is a nice step-up in power past 3000rpm and the motor really gets in its stride past 5000rpm all the way to the redline. This lends the motor a nice linear power delivery, which makes it relaxing to drive.The new Elantra betters the old car in almost every way, especially in terms of dynamics. If you are primarily looking for an all-rounder with good space, a premium cabin and lots of features, the Elantra is one of the best in its segment. Both the petrol and diesel motors have good grunt and ARAI efficiency figures look promising too. Another strong attribute of the Elantra is the refinement, thanks to both the motors being exceptionally silent. So when you add all of it together you get a car that gets you your money’s worth, especially considering how well Hyundai has priced it. The proven service backing and Hyundai’s premium Assurance scheme means the Elantra is a premium sedan that’s easy to recommend. The Hyundai Elantra rivals the likes of the Skoda Octavia, VW Jetta and Toyota Corolla Altis. With an introductory price of Rs 12.99 lakh for the base Elantra, Hyundai has managed to undercut the Corolla by nearly a lakh and the Jetta and the Octavia are not even in the picture. By pricing it so competitively, the Elantra is very close to the smaller Verna too.

Best VFM D-segment sedan
for Hyundai Elantra on 04-Oct-2018 by Ashwin M</font><br>

If you are in the market for a petrol D-segment sedan, the Elantra should be on top of your list. Much cheaper than the Octavia and Corolla, the Elantra is a very underrated car. It is the best<br><br>

Excellent choice for a premium sedan
for Hyundai Elantra on 22-May-2017 by Manish Mathur</font><br>

Exterior This is a head turner with stylish curves and a coupe like body. Build quality is very good and you can feel it when the heavy doors closed with a thud sound. The LED are good too.<br><br>
